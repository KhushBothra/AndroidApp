# AndroidApp
the project is to create an interface for bus conductors to issue tickets by making payments by nfc cards.
the current application does not open up at all. it has all the nfc permissions it needs and the device i am using is nfc enabled. when i ta an nfc card on the device, it even tries to open the app but it crashes.
i sense the issue must be due to some changes i made to the gradle files, probably the sdk version compatibility issues.
unfortunately the laptop i am using does not support haxm. meaning that i am unable to debug the application. therefore all i know is from running the apks on my phone and from comparing my code to the code online.
